# Personal-Website
Personal website with information about myself. This is an attempt to teach myself some fundamentals of full stack web development. Here's the goal: 

-Main page with fancy visuals that display some stuff about me/my projects etc
-A couple side pages to display these things, including contact info, resume, photos
-Potentially will host my "hashtags displayed as pins on a google map" project that I desperately want to finish. THAT'S the ultimate goal of this project. 
-Google analytics seems kinda cool so I might try and include that
